# Energy Kooks Project

## Background
Evaluate Human Development Index (HDI)  against renewable energy usage (RE%). We will evaluate whether countries with higher HDI utilize more or less renewable energy. We will look at RE% growth or shrinkage vs HDI deltas. Once we have our results we will have to look at what other factors influence renewable usage. 

## Research Questions:
1. Do countries with a higher HDI consume more renewable energy (relative to other countries)? Are developed countries more or less likely to use renewable energy compared to developing or underdeveloped countries?
2. Which countries are most effective at increasing renewable energy share, developed or developing countries?
